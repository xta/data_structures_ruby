# Exercise: work with linked list(s)

# Notes
# * linked lists allow us to maintain a collection of relative items. there is no requirement that they are in contiguous memory
# * the location of the first item (head) must be tracked
# * each item should know the location of the next item
# * the last item should know that there is no next item
